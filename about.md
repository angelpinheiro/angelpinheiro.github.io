I got the graduate degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain) in 2011. I'm currently doing the Master's Degree in Information Technologies at this university while I'm hired by a research project in the CiTIUS, where I work in mobile and web development, especially in the field of ubiquitous healthcare services.
